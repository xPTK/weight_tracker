Flutter & Firebase Home Project: Weight Tracker

Implement a simple weight tracker app using Firebase Auth and Cloud Firestore.

On first launch, the app lets users sign in with Firebase (use anonymous sign-in for simplicity).

After sign in, the app shows a page where the user can: </br>
-Enter his/her weight into a form and submit it </br>
-Save this along with the current time into Firestore </br>
-View a list of all weight entries, sorted by most recent date </br>

The app should update in realtime when the data changes on Firestore.

Bonus features: </br>
-Edit an existing weight entry </br>
-Delete entries </br>
-Sign-out functionality </br>

Notes: </br>
-feel free to use dependency injection libraries such as Provider or get_it if appropriate. </br>
-when building the UI and navigating between screens, choose the approach that makes most sense in terms of usability. </br>
-adding tests is not required for this project, but the final code should be testable. </br>

If some requirements appear to be vague or lack sufficient details, make assumptions based on your own judgment.

The assignment will be evaluated according to the following criteria: </br>
-the app works and satisfies the requirements outlined above </br>
-general project structure and organization of code </br>
-separation of concerns between UI, authentication, database code </br>
-simplicity - we don't require an over-engineered solution </br>
-naming conventions for variables, functions and classes </br>

Making the UI look nice is not required as part of this task - legible text and usable UI is sufficient.
